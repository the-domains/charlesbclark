"I once rode a chariot around a frozen lake with a small group of friends and hot chocolate. The chocolate was so hot I accidentally spilt it on my friends. We had a snowball fight after that, and the chariot disappeared. Or maybe the chariot was never there to begin with. I just like telling stories." - Hypothetically what Charles is narrating with this picture. He's never actually said that before though.
